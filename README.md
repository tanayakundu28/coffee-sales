# Coffee Sales Analysis Excel Project

## Overview
This Excel project is focused on analyzing coffee sales data using advanced Excel functions and tools such as XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, Pivot Tables, slicers, and visualization techniques. The goal of this project is to gain insights into coffee sales performance, identify top customers, analyze sales by various attributes, and track profitability over time.

## Project Contents
### 1. Data Sources
The project uses multiple data sources containing information on coffee sales. These data sources may include:

Sales Data: Contains information about each coffee sale, including date, customer, product, quantity, and sales amount.

Customer Data: Includes customer information such as customer name, contact details, and location.

Product Data: Contains details about coffee products, including coffee type, roast type, package size, and price.

Country Data: Provides information on the countries where sales are made, including country name and associated data.

### 2. Data Integration
The project involves integrating data from these sources using Excel functions like XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH. These functions help consolidate data from different tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.

### 3. Pivot Tables and Visualization
Pivot Tables are used to create dynamic summaries of the sales data. The following visualizations are generated:

Total Sales Over Time: A timeline chart showing the trend of total coffee sales over a specified period.

Slicers: Slicers are added to filter data based on coffee type, coffee roast type, and package size, allowing for interactive exploration of the data.

Top 5 Customers: A table or chart displaying the top 5 customers with the highest sales.

Sales by Country: A visualization showcasing sales figures for different countries.

Year-Wise Profit: A chart displaying profit trends over the years.

Top 5 Profit-Producing Customers: A table or chart showing the top 5 customers generating the highest profits.

## Instructions for Running the Project
Data Preparation: Ensure that all data sources are correctly structured and linked to the main workbook. Make sure the necessary Excel functions (XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH) have been correctly implemented.

Pivot Tables: Verify that Pivot Tables are correctly set up with appropriate filters and calculations.

Slicers: Interact with slicers to filter data based on coffee type, coffee roast type, and package size.

Visualizations: Review the generated visualizations to gain insights into coffee sales performance.

Data Updates: If the source data changes, make sure to refresh the Pivot Tables and visualizations to reflect the latest information.

## Conclusion
This Excel project on coffee sales analysis provides valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability. The use of advanced Excel functions and visualization tools enhances the decision-making process for coffee sales-related strategies. A snap of the dasboard is attached.
